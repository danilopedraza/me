                <h1>Hi!</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a student and a technology enthusiast. I like to solve problems and to understand how things work.
                    I passionately study the topics I am interested in, only when I'm interested in them. My interests tend to last!
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    I like to study about programming languages, because designing and implementing them are challenging tasks.
                    I have an interest in systems programming in general.
                </p>

                <p>I have most of my personal projects and contributions on <a href="https://github.com/danilopedraza">GitHub</a> as public repos. I don't have a lot. I'm also in <a href="https://gitlab.com/cesarpedraza">GitLab</a>!</p>
                
                <br>

                <p>I also have a <a href="../blog/">blog</a> where I post things sometimes.</p>

                <br>
                
                <h2>More about me</h2>
                
                <p>I'm a free (as in freedom) software enthusiast, and I think that it is the best way of making software. I believe in transparency as a fundamental principle of any labor.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I listen a lot of electronic music, but I like fast music in general. I always liked this kind of music, and I never have understood my music preferences completely. I repost music that I like in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/eternangustia">my SoundCloud account</a>.</p>

                <br>

                <p>I'm also a fan of science fiction and stories with technical detail. I enjoy thinking about what our future could be like and how our present might have turned out differently, while also imagining how someone from the past would interpret our experiences. This is what I like most about science fiction: there are authors who take feats that are unreachable given our current circumstances and narrate them in a way that makes them seem plausible.

                <br>

                <p>I'm a fan of strength sports, specially Olympic Weightlifting.</p>
